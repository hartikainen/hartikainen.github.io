about: "I am a visiting scholar at the <a href='http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/'>Robotic AI and Learning Lab (RAIL)</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, working with <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/'>Sergey Levine</a> and <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~haarnoja/'>Tuomas Haarnoja</a> on model-free reinforcement learning. I currently enjoy developing new reinforcement algorithms and applying reinforcement learning methods to real-world robotic tasks. I highly respect elegant, scalable, and reusable (open-source) software. Prior to joining RAIL, I received a Master's degree in Computer Science from Aalto University in Finland and worked at a small three-man startup, <a href='https://www.statwing.com/'>Statwing</a>, which was later acquired by Qualtrics."
