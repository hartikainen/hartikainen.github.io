about: "I am a Ph.D. student at <a href='http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk'>Whiteson Research Lab (WhiRL)</a> at University of Oxford, advised by <a href='http://whirl.cs.ox.ac.uk/member/shimon-whiteson/'>Shimon Whiteson</a>. My research interests are in machine learning and robotics, and most recently I've focused on model-free deep reinforcement learning for real-world robotic control. I also spend my time working on open-source projects like <a href='https://github.com/ray-project/ray'>Ray</a> and <a href='https://github.com/rail-berkeley/softlearning'>Softlearning</a>.

Prior to joining WhiRL, I did research at <a href='http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/'>Robotic AI and Learning Lab (RAIL)</a> at the University of California, Berkeley, where I worked with <a href='https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~svlevine/'>Sergey Levine</a> and <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VT7peyEAAAAJ&hl=en'>Tuomas Haarnoja</a>. I also spent a couple years as a software engineer in the industry, building statistical analysis and machine learning products at <a href='https://www.statwing.com/'>Statwing</a> and Qualtrics."
